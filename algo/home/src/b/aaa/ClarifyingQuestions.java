    // How big is the input size? The range of values?
    // What are the kind of values? Negative numbers? Floating points? Empty or invalid inputs
    // What are some extreme test cases?
    // Are there any time and space complexities constraints?
    // Do I need to handle duplicates?
    // How is the input stored?

    // Is the input already sorted?
    // Input limits and output formats.
    // Do you want me to write the output to stdout? or return it directly

    // How do you want to handle empty case, null cases?

    // Ask for an example of input and output
    // Clarify the data type
    // Clarify any kinds of restrictions in range (e.g will there be numbers bigger than the largest int?)
    // Ask about whether you need to deal with certain edge cases or not.
    // Make sure you can or cannot use certain libraries and features of the language you are programming in.
    // If you have 2 solutions in mind ask whether it is more important to prioritize time or space complexity


    // Before you start coding out your solution make sure you do the following:
    //
    // Tell your interviewer what your potential solution is - if you think its a brute force solution or
    // that it can be improved share that with them as well.
    // Walk through an example using your solution to illustrate how it might work
    // Break your solution down into different steps and write down pseudo-code or function skeletons to give your
    // interviewer a better idea of what you are thinking.
    // Test your solution on various different edge cases to see if you've missed anything. Ask your interviewer for their opinion as well.
